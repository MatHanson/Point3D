# Point3D

Built in Java, Point3D consists of two classes, Point3D and TestPoint3D. 

### Analysis

- The Point3D class is intended to provide constructors for Point3D objects, public accessors in order to access and display private variables in separate classes, and methods to calculate the distance between two Point3D objects.

- The TestPoint3D class is intended to test the Point3D class and all of its methods. This class will provide methods to create arrays of objects using random points, and search arrays to find the two closest points as well as the two farthest points. 

### Testing 

The program was tested with the provided data, which tested the no-arg constructor as well as constructor with arguments. The method to create an array of objects was tested with random numbers as the x, y, z coordinates. This array was then used to test the maximum and minimum distance methods.
